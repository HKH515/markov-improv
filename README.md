## Setup
Run
```
pip3 intall setuptools
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
then run `python3 app.py` to launch the webserver.
The site is available at `localhost:5000`

## Issues
The server crashes and gives a UnicodeDecodeError when run on some Windows machines, I advice running this on GNU+Linux machine if possible as it has only been tested on that. Might work on Mac OS.
